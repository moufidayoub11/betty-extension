## How to Contribute to the Quick Fix Feature üõ†Ô∏è

Contributing to the Quick Fix feature is a great way to improve the Betty Extension for everyone. Follow the steps below to get started:

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js
- Visual Studio Code installed on your machine
- A fork of the [Betty Extension repository](https://github.com/moufidayoub/betty-extension)

### Steps

1. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/betty-extension.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Quick Fix File**: Open the project in VS Code and navigate to the file that handles the Quick Fix feature (`BettyQuickFixProvider.js` or equivalent).

3. **Add Your Error Message and Fixing Function**: Locate the `errorFixingFunctions` object. Add a new key-value pair where the key is the error message you want to handle, and the value is the function that handles it.

    ```javascript
    const errorFixingFunctions = {
        // ...existing error handlers
        'your new error message': yourFixingFunction,
    };
    ```

4. **Implement Your Fixing Function**: Write the function that will fix the error. Make sure to follow the existing coding style and guidelines.

    ```javascript
    function yourFixingFunction(document, fix, range) {
        // Your code here
    }
    ```

5. **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting a pull request, make sure to test your changes thoroughly.

6. **Commit and Push**: Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added quick fix for 'your new error message'"
    git push origin main
    ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the GitHub page of your forked repository and create a new pull request.

### Example

Here's a simple example to demonstrate how to add a new quick fix for the error message "missing semicolon":

```javascript
// Add to errorFixingFunctions object
const errorFixingFunctions = {
    // ...existing error handlers
    'missing semicolon': addMissingSemicolon,
};

// Implement the fixing function
function addMissingSemicolon(document, fix, range) {
    // Your code to add a missing semicolon
}
```
